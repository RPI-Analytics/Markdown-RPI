## Creating a Course Website Using Markdown and Github


### Why Markdown and Github?

(1) Creates a very professional looking website in almost no time.  
(2) Easy for students to access information.
(3) Easy to update information.
(4) Easy to reuse information from year to year.
(5) Easy to collaborate with other content creaters.
(6) Version control.


### Getting Started
- A github *repository* is the foundation for a class website. This requires at least one markdown file, `readme.md`.  
- A repository is a "digital directory or storage space where you can access your project, its files, and all the versions of its files that Git saves." - [readwrite.com](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/)
- Can be used for a wesite, or to share files as well. 


### Example Repository  
- Fork an [example repository](https://github.com/RPI-Analytics/class-webpage-example) in order to get your first website started.  
- Click on **Settings->Source->Master Branch**
- Click on **Theme Chooser**
- It will take a few minutes to generate your website, but that is it!


### Creating a New Page
- Relative references are allowed for links, so you just need to include something like:

```
[New class page](./class_new.md)
```

### Use a GIST for your New Page. 
- *Probably not the best practice, but for some reason I got into habit of doing this.*
- Go to [https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)


### Tips and Tricks
- To copy from a markdown page to another, click on the *RAW* button.
