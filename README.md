# Markdown, Jupyter, and Github as a New Publishing Paradigm for Classroom Content



## Why take this session?

Markdown is a versatile tool that can be used throughout the teaching experience.  With markdown you can prepare slides, notes, interactive demonstrations, write computer code, include images in documents and typeset equations.  When paired with tools such as Project Jupyter and GitHub it can be a gamechanger for the way you work in the classroom and give you an opportunity to have a broader impact in your domain of expertise.

## Who is this session for?

Anyone who prepares classroom or lab content to be curated alone or in teams for delivery to students.

## How can I use markdown to help me in the classroom?

* Markdown/Github can help you to quickly create a styled course website without learning HTML.
* Markdown/Jupyter can allow you to combine (1) content/narrative, (2) equations/formulas, (3) calculation/computation, (4) assignments, and (5) presentations. 
* Provides access to what is potentially a new publishing paradigm.

## What will I learn in this session?

After taking this one-hour tutorial the attendee will:

* Understand the contexts where Markdown is used
* See one example classroom use-case
* Explore and use the basic syntax of Markdown
* (If all goes well) Develop one or two examples on your own

### Jupyter Notebooks

One example use-case for Markdown is through the Jupyter Project's Jupyter notebook.  The link to that project is [here](http://jupyter.org/index.html).  Our intent in this tutorial is to provide access to a Jupyter notebook for the attendee so that you can write some content.  This might be for a class, a homework assignment, a lab tutorial or similar.  

While not specific to the Jupyter notebook, the notebook interface provides a simple way for us to practice markdown with a minimum of overhead.

### Interactive session

Let's get started!

# TLDR/Can't Attend?  Here are the basics:

## (1) Getting Started with Markdown

```
For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

(TBD put in example on using equations)

## (2) Getting Started with Github for a Course Webpage

Github can automatically create a course website for you from markdown. This website is created using markdown. From it you can see:
- [Click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RPI-Analytics/markdown-RPi/master/README.md) to see the raw markdown. 
- [Click here](https://github.com/RPI-Analytics/markdown-RPi/blob/master/README.md) to see the styleized version.
- [Click here](https://rpi-analytics.github.io/markdown-RPi/) to see the website which is automatically generated through a cool tool [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (which you don't have to learn anything about.   

[Here](https://jkuruzovich.github.io/tech-fundamentals-analytics/) is an example of a full course website.  This is just for content delivery and not for grading or assignments.  We still use the LMS for that. 

Want to create a separate page for each week of the course?  Throw it in a [GIST](https://gist.github.com) as we did in [this example](https://gist.github.com/jkuruzovich/f55f10c4e8dee3e137fec4be06c58e91).

## (3) Try Jupyter 

Want to get markdown + programming/computiation +  naritive + automated slides + autograding all in one package? [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) is an open source project that allows a tremendous amound of different languages (Python, R, Matlab, Ruby, etc) in an interactive notebook environment.  It is being used in [Google's DataLab Project](https://cloud.google.com/datalab/), [IBM's Data Science Experience](http://datascience.ibm.com), and [Microsoft's Azure ML Studio](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2015/07/24/introducing-jupyter-notebooks-in-azure-ml-studio/).

Here are a couple of ways to try it out:
- Go to [tmpnb.org](http://tmpnb.org) to launch your own Jupyter notebook.  

## (4) Workshop Slides
